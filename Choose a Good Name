The step of choosing the name of the project in open source projects is considered one of the most critical
steps that developers must consider before starting the project.In addition, it is considered a creative step
,as developers choose a name that reflects the project's goals and motives.

My team went through several steps to select a name for the project we generated a list of names that reflectes values of th project.
the list of possible names:
1.BookDash
2.ReadWell
3.ShelfSpace
4.BookWise
5.ReadEase
6.BookHaven

then , we took a vote among the team memebrs to determine the name of the project . most of  the team memebers voted to sixth name in the list .
Our decision on the project name was influenced by the following factors:  
1. ensure that the project name is unique to avoid duplication.
2. the project's name reflects its purpose and its motivation. 
3. The project name is memorable and easy to pronounce.
