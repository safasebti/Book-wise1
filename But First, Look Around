Before we started our Book Store managament systemn first we searched arounf for similar systems to see if they have the same purpose 
of our system and if they will have similar features or different ones. We also did research to make sure that the project name was not taken
by other people or companies so we can avoid problelms and confusion to the developers and the users of the system.

So here are some examples and links to the projects that we found so you can check them out :

1. Koha - https://github.com/Koha-Community/Koha
2. OpenBiblio - https://github.com/openbiblio/openbiblio
3. NewGenLib - https://github.com/NewGenLib/newgenlib
4. Invenio - https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio
